# I decided to use "LifeCycleSavings" dataset that is included within R.  I'm including the
# description of the dataset for reference purposes

?LifeCycleSavings

# A data frame with 50 observations on 5 variables.
#
# [,1]   sr	 numeric	 aggregate personal savings
# [,2]	 pop15	 numeric	 % of population under 15
# [,3]	 pop75	 numeric	 % of population over 75
# [,4]	 dpi	 numeric	 real per-capita disposable income
# [,5]	 ddpi	 numeric	 % growth rate of dpi

attach(LifeCycleSavings)

# A histogram is good for describing the distrubtion of measurements.  If we use a histogram
# to plot the personal savings (sr) in the dataset, we see an interesting distribution:

hist(sr)

# With this we see a right-skewed bell curve, showing nearly all observations fall below the 
# median or within 1 standard deviation.  In real-world terms this means that the vast majority of 
# people have very little savings or moderate savings.

# Box plots are also handly and viewing the distribution of observations, especially when looking for outliers.
# When looking at the Disposable Income (dpi), of various countries, the extremes become apparent when using
# a boxplot:

boxplot(dpi,main="Boxplot of Disposable Income",ylab="Per-capita Disposable Income")

# As we can see the maximum is stretched very far from the median.

# A histogram shows as the same thing, an almost perfectly right-skewed curve:

hist(dpi,main="Histogram of Disposable Income",xlab="Per-capital Disposable Income")


# Looking at the two age variables (pop15 and pop75), we can gain some insight into world population.
# Using a scatterplot with these two variables can give us some visualization as to their relationship.

plot(pop15,pop75)

# We see a pretty clear negative correlation.  Using R's cor() function we can quantify this:

cor(pop15,pop75)

# The result we get is -0.9084787, an almost perfect negative correlation.  In real world terms this means that 
# as the percentage of the population that is younger (15 and under) increases, the percentage of the population that 
# is elderly (75+) decreases.

# But how does the percentage of young people in a society affect finances?  Let us look at a scatterplot of
# pop15 versus dpi:

plot(dpi,pop15)

# Not looking good for the young folk.  A clear negative coorelation between younger people in the population and 
# disposable income in the population.  Quantified:

cor(dpi,pop15)

# -0.7561881

# How about savings?  We might expect to see similar results:

plot(sr,pop15)

# The scatterplot gives us a strange picture, not as clear as the previous ones.  Quanitifying the correlation:

cor(sr,pop15)

# -0.4555381

# We see a moderate negative correlation.  In real world terms this means that while the presence of young people
# in a population has a strong negative correlation on disposable income (ask a Parent, kids are expensive), it 
# has a weaker (although still present) negative correlation on savings.
