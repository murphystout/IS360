# 1. OSEMN

# Obtain - Get data in a scalable way, via programatic methods, not just copy-paste.
# Scrub - Get rid of the noise in the data, use programming languages to work over the data to remove the noise.
# Explore - Visualizations of the data to inspire theories and hypotheses.
# Model - No clue.  Some type of mathematical derivation, something about different order polynomials.
# Interpret - Use the model to point where to explore next, qualitatively.

# 2. To yeild a better program right away I would opt for better implementation and 
# merely decent functions.  Perhaps I'm naive but implementation is everything.
# However it may be better to opt for well designed function interfaces and slack
# on implementation if there is a longterm plan in the works, and this implementation
# is only an early stage.

# 4. POSIXct vs POSIXlt

# Both ct and lt POSIX variations have very similar practical applications.
# From what I can see they are nearly identical in treatment.
# I would use POSIXlt for very long periods of time, i.e. calculating the 
# age of the universe, while reserving POSIXct for more pedestrian efforts.
