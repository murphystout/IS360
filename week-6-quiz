# 1 Describe in one or two sentences what is contained in the 
# caith dataset.

require(MASS)
caith
?caith

# The 'caith' dataset is a table of data pertaining to the 
# eye color and hair color of people in Caithness, Scotland.
# The rows indication eye color while the columns indicate hair
# color.

# 2. Describe what is stored in variable EyeColor

require(MASS)
data(caith)
EyeColor  <- rowSums(caith)

# EyeColor is a numeric vector containing the total number of 
# people that have a specific eye color (from within the caith
# dataset)

# 3.Create a new variable called HairColor that is a numeric vector with the total hair
# colors across different eye colors. 

HairColor <- colSums(caith)

# 4. Create a histogram of EyeColors.  What is the most common Eye Color?

# Professor, the only way I found to do this was to use the BarPlot function.
# Searching online it seems like this is a common problem (being unable to have 
# the numeric vector values represent # of observations, instead of being observations
# themselves) and no one seems to have a solution.  Barplots do seem like a 
# decent alternative, however.

barplot(EyeColor, xlab="Eye Color", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Eye Color Histogram")

# The most common eye color is 'Medium'

#5. Describe what this line of code does:

caitha <- as.matrix(caith)

# This sets the variable "caitha" to a matrix data type, using the 'caith' data frame
# as the source data.

# 6. Describe what the following line of code does:

barplot(t(as.matrix(caith)))

# This code displays a barplot of data.  The data is a transposition of a matrix. 
# The matrix contains the data from the data frame 'Caith'.

# 7. Modify the code above:

barplot(t(as.matrix(caith)), beside = TRUE)

# 8. Is there a relationship between eye color and hair color?

# Taking a look at the barplot we see that there is a relationship
# between some eye and hair colors:

barplot(as.matrix(caith),beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE)

# 'Light' eye color is most commonly observed with 'Fair' hair color.
# 'Medium' eye color is most commonly observed with 'Medium' hair color.
# 'Dark' eye color is most commonly observed with 'Dark' hair color.
# 'Black' hair is most commonly observed with 'Dark' eye color.
