#The graphic below shows four datasets, each with 2 variables and 10 observations. Show off what 
#you’ve learned so far in the course by using R to analyzeand compare the data in these datasets. 
#You may work alone or with up to three other students on this assignment.
#(Remember that assignments are worth 10 points and projects are worth 100 points, so plan 
# accordingly; you’ll receive full credit on the assignment if you turn in something reasonable).

# There are 4 sets of data.  Let's first examine them using scatterplots and correlation tests 

cor(x1,y1)
# 0.8164205 - Strong Correlation
plot(x1,y1)

cor(x2,y2)
# 0.8162365 - Strong Correlation
plot(x2,y2)

cor(x3,y3)
# 0.8162867 - Strong Correlation
plot(x3,y3)

cor(x4,y4)
# 0.8165214 - Strong Correlation
plot(x4,y4)

# All 4 sets have strong correlation between the X and Y values.

# Now let us identify any potential outliers in the data set.  Boxplots are good for this:

boxplot(w7data)

# This shows us y2, x3,x4 and y4 all have outliers.  This should be investigated further with the source data
# to confirm these are accurate measurements.


# Let's use ggplot2 to analyze a little further, using histograms

require(ggplot2)

# Let us look at all the y values in all 4 data sets:

ggplot(w7data, aes(x = c(y1,y2,y3,y4))) + geom_histogram()

# We get whats look to be a normal bell curve.  Do we see the same with the x-values?

ggplot(w7data, aes(x = c(x1,x2,x3,x4))) + geom_histogram()

# We don't, the x-values are not normally distributed.

# We will see the same type of distributions using density plots:

ggplot(data = w7data) + geom_density(aes(x = c(x1,x2,x3,x4)))

ggplot(data = w7data) + geom_density(aes(x = c(y1,y2,y3,y4)))

# Findings:
# All 4 datasets have strong correlation.
# y2,x3,x4 and y4 have outliers that need to be investigated.
# the x values do not follow a bell curve
# the y values tend to follow a normal bell curve
