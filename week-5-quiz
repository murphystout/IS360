# Tidy Data
# 1. Data ____ is what Hadley Wickham calls structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.
# A. Tidying

# 2. In tidy data, there are three properties. One of these properties states that “each type of
# observational unit forms a table.” What are the other two properties of tidy data

# A. Each variable is a column, and each observation is a row.

# According to Hadley Wickham, what are the five most common problems with messy datasets?

# A. 1. Column Headers are not variable names, they are values.
#    2. More than one variable is stored in a column.
#    3. More than one observational unit is stored in a single table.
#    4. One observational unit is stored in multiple tables.
#    5. Variables are stored in rows and columns (should only be in columns). 

# 4. Provide a one sentence definition for each of the four fundamental verbs of data manipulation:
# 
# a. Filter - Removing observations from a dataset (creating a subset)
# b. Transform - adding variables or modifying variables (e.g. with a function)
# c. Aggregate - Collapsing multiple variables into a single variable.
# d. Sort - changing the order of observations.

# 5. What is the function in base R used for filtering?
# A. subset()

# “Introduction to dplyr”
# 1.What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the dplyr package versus the plyr package?
# A.There is dramatic speed improvements with dplyr.  It also uses the %.% operator to chain together 
# operations, making them easier to read and understand.
# As for disadvantages, dplyr only works with data frames, and does not support lists, etc.
#
# 2.What are the advantages and disadvantage of using plyr versus the base R apply family of functions?
# A.The advantages of using the plyr package is that the **ply function family makes the split-apply-combine
# methods of data analysis much easier than with base R functions.
# A disadvantage is that of speed.  The plyr functions are slower than base R.  It is a trade-off between speed
# and convenience.

# tidyr
# 1. What are the two verbs (functions) in the tidyr package that correspond to the spreadsheet
# functions pivot and unpivot? 

# A. Pivot corresponds to the tidyr function gather()
#    Unpivot corresponds to the tidyr function spread()
