# 1. Write down 3 questions that you might want to answer based on this data.
# What percentage of young (16-24) Edinburgh residents voted Yes in the poll.
# What percentage of young (16-24) Glasgow residents voted Yes in the poll.
# What percentage of older (25+) Glasgow residents voted Yes in the poll.

# 2. Create an R data frame with 2 observations to store this data in
# its current “messy” state. Use whatever method you want to re-create 
# and/or load the data.

column.names <- c("Edinburgh/16-24", "Edinburgh/25+","Glasgow/16-24", "Glasgow/25+","Vote")

col1 <- c(80100,35900)
col2 <- c(14300,214800)
col3 <- c(99400,43000)
col4 <- c(150400,207000)
col5 <- c("Yes","No")

df <- data.frame(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5)

colnames(df) <- column.names

# 3. Use the functionality in the tidyr package to convert the data
# frame to be “tidy data.”

df <- df %>% 
  gather(key,value,-Vote) %>% 
  separate(key,c("City","Age"),"/") %>% 
  spread(Vote,value)

# 4.Use the functionality in the plyr package to
# answer the questions that you asked in step 1.

votesplit <- function(data) {
  YesPercent = data$Yes/(data$No+data$Yes)
  NoPercent = data$No/(data$No+data$Yes)
  return(data.frame(data,"Yes.Percentage" = YesPercent, "No.Percentage" = NoPercent))
}

df <- ddply(df,c("Yes","No"),votesplit)


df %>% filter(City == "Edinburgh" & Age == "16-24") %>% 
select(City, Age, Yes.Percentage)

df %>% filter(City == "Glasgow" & Age == "16-24") %>% 
  select(City, Age, Yes.Percentage)

df %>% filter(City == "Glasgow" & Age == "25+") %>% 
  select(City, Age, Yes.Percentage)

# 5. Having gone through the process, would you ask different questions and/or 
# change the way that you structured your data frame?

# I wouldn't ask different questions.  The process of tidying the messy data taught me 
# to not treat observations as variables (specifically, Age was being treated as a variable
# with vote counts the associated observation.  This caused issues with the tidying).
