theURL <- "http://www.jaredlander.com/2012/02/another-kind-of-super-bowl-pool/"
bowlPool <- readHTMLTable(theURL, which = 1, header = FALSE, stringsasFactors = FALSE)

# 1. What type of data structure is bowlpool?

class(bowlPool)
# Data Frame

# 2. Suppose instead you call readHTMLTable() with just the URL argument, against the provided URL, as shown below:

theURL = "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp"
hvalues = readHTMLTable(theURL)

# What is the type of variable returned in hvalues?

class(hvalues)

# List

# 3. Write R Code that shows how many HTML Tables are represented in hvalues

# Note: Not sure if Null HTML tables count.  It seems to be implied that this is more than
# just a length() command, but I included both:

length(hvalues)
sum(as.vector(lapply(hvalues,class) == "data.frame"))

# 4. Modify the readHTMLTable code so that just the table with Number,Firstname,LastName and Points is returned in a dataframe.
# Note: While the code below satisfies the requirements, I wasn't able to find a way
# to specifie column names via readHTMLTable.  I could only do it with the which parameter.  
# I'll check in with your during office hours tonight

q4 <- readHTMLTable(theURL, which = 1)

# 5. Modify the returned data frame so only the Last Name and Points Columns are shown.

q4[,c("Last Name","Points")]

# 6. Identify another interesting web page with HTML table values

q6URL <- "http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/hardware/screw-nail-sizes"

# 7. How many html tables does that page contain?
# Note: Again including both Null and non-Null tables

q6 <- readHTMLTable(q6URL)
length(q6)
sum(as.vector(lapply(q6,class) == "data.frame"))

# 8. Identify your web browser and describe how you view HTML page source in your web browser.

# My web browser is FireFox, and I use CTRL + U to view source.
